# FoodBox_web_project
Its a online food ordering web application, My own style music player.
Developed in JAVA.

Food box is a dynamic online food ordering project where we
can sign up easily and login without any problem. A customer
can view the products, hotels etc. and can easily place order. For
this project I used many programming languages like java,
JavaScript, html, CSS, bootstrap, API, jQuery, JDBC, servlet,
jsp. Used various types of method like Get and Post method.
Many operations are CRUD, MVC flow.
â€¢ Serviced CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality
for events, granting users streamlined event management
capabilities and realising a 15% boost in operational efficiency
